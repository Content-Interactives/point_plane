# Point on a Plane Interactive

This repository contains the code for the **Point on a Plane Interactive**, designed to introduce elementary students to the concept of **coordinates** by placing points on a plane. Students learn how to identify and describe positions using ordered pairs in a fun, visual way.

## 📚 Standards & Subjects

This interactive aligns with the following topics and standards:

- **📂 Subject Area**: Elementary Math (Geometry)
- **🔷 Topic**: Coordinate plane basics — identifying and plotting points using ordered pairs
- **📏 Common Core**:
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.G.A.1** – Use a pair of perpendicular number lines, called axes, to define a coordinate system, with the intersection of the lines (the origin) arranged to coincide with the 0 on each line. Understand that the x-coordinate and y-coordinate define the location of each point in the plane.
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.G.A.2** – Represent real world and mathematical problems by graphing points in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane, and interpret coordinate values of points in the context of the situation.
